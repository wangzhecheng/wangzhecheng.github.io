I am a HAI (Human-Centered AI) Postdoctoral Fellow at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). 
My research aims to **transform raw pixels into actionable insights** to support decision making for **equitable** mitigation and adaptation of climate change. 
Specifically, I develop machine learning models for multi-modal geospatial data (e.g., remote sensing images, geo-tagged text) to understand *"what is going on?"* especially in developing countries and disadvantaged communities. I further leverage these observations to inform *"what can we do?"* (e.g., policy making). 
My main application areas include: (1) the adoption of renewable energy (e.g., solar PVs); (2) the resilience of infrastructure (e.g., electrical grids) to climate-induced extreme weather events. 
My current technical interests are multi-modal learning and foundation models applied on geospatial data.

Previously, I obtained my PhD degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering with minor in Computer Science at Stanford in 2022, co-advised by [Prof. Ram Rajagopal](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ram-rajagopal) and [Prof. Arun Majumdar](https://profiles.stanford.edu/arun-majumdar). I obtained my M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford in 2018, and my Bachelor's degree in Energy and Power Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2016.
