I am a PhD student in Civil and Environmental Engineering (with minor in Computer Science) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). I am co-advised by [Prof. Ram Rajagopal](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ram-rajagopal) and [Prof. Arun Majumdar](https://profiles.stanford.edu/arun-majumdar). 
I am broadly interested in large-scale **data acquisition** and **data analytics** to support [sustainable development](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) with the cross-interdisciplinary integration of **machine learning**, **social science**, and **economics**. 
My research aims to **bridge the data gap** with machine learning and **distill data into insights** with social science and economics to **customize** the answers for different countries, regions, and communities to the broad question: how to make our world more sustainable and more resilient to climate change?

Previously, I received my M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) in 2018, and my Bachelor's degree in Energy and Power Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2016. 


Research Interests
======
Granular data are essential input for decision making at various time scales to support sustainable development. However, these data are either largely unavailable or stored in "data silos", especially for developing countries and disadvantaged communities. 
I am interested in bridging this gap by developing machine learning models to convert **multi-modal**, **unstructured**, yet **widely-available** “raw” data into **spatially- and temporally-resolved structured** data. 
I am also interested in extracting useful patterns and insights from these data to deliver real-world impact (e.g., imforming policy making).

Specially, my research interests can be summarized into two aspects:

* **Data acquisition**: semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and multi-modal learning for converting geo-tagged unstructure data (e.g., remote sensing images, geo-tagged text) into structured datasets.

* **Data analytics**: spatiotemporal data analysis and causal inference with applications in technology adoption, energy/climate justice, energy/climate policies, etc.

In my PhD research, the main application focus on distributed energy systems, including **distributed solar PV systems** and **electrical distribution grids**.
