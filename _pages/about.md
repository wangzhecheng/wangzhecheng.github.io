I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), working with [Prof. Ram Rajagopal](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ram-rajagopal) and [Prof. Arun Majumdar](https://profiles.stanford.edu/arun-majumdar). 
I am broadly interested in large-scale **data acquisition** and **data analytics** to support [sustainable development](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) with the cross-disciplinary integration of **machine learning**, **social science**, and **economics**. 
My research aims to **bridge the data gap** with machine learning and **distill data into insights** with social science and economics to **customize** the answers for different countries, regions, and communities to the broad question: how to make our energy systems and infrastructures more sustainable, equitable, and resilient to climate change?

Previously, I obtained my PhD degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering with minor in Computer Science in 2022, and my M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2018, both from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Energy and Power Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2016.

Research Interests
======
Granular data are essential input for decision making at various time scales to support sustainable development. However, these data are either largely unavailable or stored in "data silos", especially for developing countries and disadvantaged communities. 
I am interested in bridging this gap by developing machine learning models to convert **multi-modal**, **unstructured**, yet **widely-available** “raw” data into **spatially- and temporally-resolved structured** data. 
I am also interested in extracting useful patterns and insights from these data to deliver real-world impact (e.g., imforming policy making).

Specifically, my research interests can be summarized into two aspects:

* **Data acquisition**: self-supervised learning and multi-modal learning for converting widely-available geo-tagged unstructure data (e.g., remote sensing images, geo-tagged text) into structured datasets.

* **Data analytics**: spatiotemporal data analysis and causal inference with applications in technology adoption, energy/climate justice, energy/climate policies, etc.

In my PhD research, the main application focus on distributed energy systems, including **distributed solar PV systems** and **electrical distribution grids**.
