I am a [HAI (Human-Centered AI) Postdoctoral Fellow](https://hai.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. 
My research focuses on developing machine learning and other data-driven approaches to enable large-scale mapping, monitoring, and modeling of energy systems, infrastructure networks, and the urban environment. The goal of my research is to provide algorithms, data, and actionable insights for decision making (e.g., urban planning, policymaking) to enable effective, equitable, and human-centered transitions towards decarbonization and climate resilience.

My current research topics include: distributed energy resources, infrastructure networks (especially electricity distribution networks), and their interactions with other components of natural/built environments as well as the changing climate. More recently, I am interested in developing machine learning foundation models for mapping, modeling, and analyzing such interactions and for informing decision making.

<!-- My research aims to **transform raw pixels into actionable insights** to support **equitable mitigation and adaptation of climate change**. 
Specifically, I develop machine learning models for multi-modal geospatial data (e.g., remote sensing images, geo-tagged text) to understand *"what is going on?"* especially in developing countries and disadvantaged communities. I further leverage these observations to inform *"what can we do?"* (e.g., policy making). 
My main application areas include: (1) the adoption of renewable energy (e.g., solar PVs); (2) the resilience of infrastructure (e.g., electrical grids) to climate-induced extreme events. 
My current technical interests include multi-modal learning and foundation models for geospatial data. -->

Previously, I obtained my PhD degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering with minor in Computer Science at Stanford, co-advised by [Prof. Ram Rajagopal](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ram-rajagopal) and [Prof. Arun Majumdar](https://profiles.stanford.edu/arun-majumdar). I obtained my M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering also from Stanford, and my Bachelor's degree in Energy, Power System and Automation from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).
