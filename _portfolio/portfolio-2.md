title: "DeepSolar"
excerpt: "We built a nationwide solar installation database for the contiguous US utilizing a novel deep learning model applied to
satellite and aerial imagery. The data are published as the first publicly available, high-fidelity solar installation database covering all states in the contiguous US. For each solar installation, the database contains the geolocation, size, and subtype information. We demonstrated its value by identifying key environmental and socioeconomic factors correlated with solar deployment. We also developed high-accuracy machine learning models to predict solar deployment density utilizing these factors as input. We hope the data produced by DeepSolar can aid researchers, policymakers, and the industry in gaining a better understanding of solar adoption and its impacts.

The deployment of solar energy on the energy supply side plays a critical role in decarbonizing the energy sector and mitigating climate change. Compared to conventional fossil fuel energy, solar energy is more intermittent and distributed. Individual households, traditionally defined as energy consumers, can now install solar photovoltaic (PV) panels on their rooftops to produce electricity on their own and thus become energy “prosumers”. Furthermore, the electricity generated by solar PV panels can flow back to the electrical grid and, if not well managed, potentially cause instability to the entire power system. Therefore, solar PV systems are more challenging to document, coordinate, and manage than conventional centralized power generators.

In this project, we developed DeepSolar, a deep learning framework that identifies geolocations, sizes, and subtypes of solar PV panels from satellite and aerial images. Relying on its high accuracy and scalability, we further constructed a comprehensive high-fidelity solar deployment database for the contiguous U.S. Due to the scarcity of ground truth annotations of solar panel sizes, we developed a weakly-supervised approach to both identify solar panels and estimated their sizes with a single neural network using only image-level class labels as supervision. We deployed the model to over 1 billion satellite image tiles across the contiguous U.S. in mid-2017 and constructed a geospatial database containing 1.47 million solar systems which have been further classified into different subtypes in- cluding residential PVs, commercial PVs, and utility-scale PVs.

We demonstrated its value by discovering that residential solar deployment density peaks at a population density of 1,000 capita/mile<sup>2</sup>, increases with annual household income asymptoting at $150k, and has an inverse correlation with the Gini index representing income inequality. We uncovered a solar radiation threshold (4.5 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>/day) above which the solar deployment is "triggered". Furthermore, we also built an accurate machine learningbased predictive model to estimate the solar deployment density at the census tract level. We offer the DeepSolar database as a publicly available resource for researchers, utilities, solar developers, and policymakers to further uncover solar deployment patterns, build comprehensive economic
and behavioral models, and ultimately support the adoption and management of solar electricity.

We are now working on updating this database to 2022. Stay tuned!
