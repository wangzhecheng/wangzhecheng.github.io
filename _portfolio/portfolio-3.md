title: "DeepGrid"
excerpt: "Detailed and location-aware distribution grid information is a prerequisite for various power system applications such as renewable energy integration, wildfire risk assessment, and in- frastructure planning. However, a generalizable and scalable approach to obtain such infor- mation is still lacking. In this work, we developed a machine-learning-based framework to map both overhead and underground distribution grids using widely-available multi-modal data including street view images, road networks, and building maps. It is developed with the data in the U.S. but can be directly transferred to Africa without any re-training or fine-tuning

Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are being deployed at a rapid yet non-uniform pace. To explain this heterogeneity across space and time, in the DeepSolar++ project, we applied computer vision to historical satellite and aerial images to uncover **when** solar PVs have been installed on top of the DeepSolar project that investigated the problem of **where**. We, therefore, constructed a spatiotemporal dataset of PV deployment in the United States. We analyzed the data using a technology diffusion model and found that low-income communities are not only delayed in their PV adoption onset but also saturate more quickly at lower levels. We also found that certain types of incentives are associated with a high saturated adoption level in low-income communities, whereas other types are not. The computer vision model we developed can be scaled to any location on Earth where historical aerial or satellite images are available at a sufficient resolution. Additionally, we make our dataset publicly available as a resource for researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders to understand PV adoption dynamics and customize policy design.
